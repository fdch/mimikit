# mimikit

`mimikit` is an open-source python package for audio and music data
modeling with neural networks.

It contains models out-of-the-box and simple utilities for dealing with audio data.
The aim of mimikit is double : it will lower the barrier to deep-learning for non-developers while providing tools to developers that enable fast experimentation.
